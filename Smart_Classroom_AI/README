# 🎓 Smart Classroom AI System

Smart Classroom AI is an **advanced real-time AI-powered classroom monitoring system** built using **Python, OpenCV, Deep Learning, and Streamlit**.  
The system automatically analyzes classroom activities using a live camera feed and provides intelligent insights, alerts, and analytics.

This project focuses on **practical, real-world classroom automation**, not just theory.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Smart Classroom AI assists teachers and institutions by:

- Automatically marking attendance
- Monitoring student engagement
- Detecting inattentiveness, drowsiness, phone usage, and abnormal behavior
- Generating real-time alerts
- Showing live analytics on a dashboard

The system works completely in **real time** using a webcam or CCTV feed.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Reduce manual attendance effort
- Improve classroom engagement monitoring
- Detect unsafe or abnormal behavior early
- Provide real-time decision support to teachers
- Build an industry-level AI system using computer vision
